Class Creational: Factory Method

Intent

Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide
which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer
instantiation to subclasses.

Also Known As

Virtual Constructor

Motivation

Frameworks use abstract classes to define and maintain relationships
between objects. A framework is often responsible for creating these
objects as well.

Consider a framework for applications that can present multiple
documents to the user. Two key abstractions in this framework are the
classes Application and Document. Both classes are abstract, and clients
have to subclass them to realize their application-specific
implementations. To create a drawing application, for example, we define
the classes DrawingApplication and DrawingDocument. The Application
class is responsible for managing Documents and will create them as
required—when the user selects Open or New from a menu, for example.

Because the particular Document subclass to instantiate is
application-specific, the Application class can’t predict the subclass
of Document to instantiate—the Application class only knows when a new
document should be created, not what kind of Document to create. This
creates a dilemma: The framework must instantiate classes, but it only
knows about abstract classes, which it cannot instantiate.

The Factory Method pattern offers a solution. It encapsulates the
knowledge of which Document subclass to create and moves this knowledge
out of the framework.

[]

Application subclasses redefine an abstract CreateDocument operation on
Application to return the appropriate Document subclass. Once an
Application subclass is instantiated, it can then instantiate
application-specific Documents without knowing their class. We call
CreateDocument a factory method because it’s responsible for
“manufacturing” an object.

Applicability

Use the Factory Method pattern when

  • a class can’t anticipate the class of objects it must create.

  • a class wants its subclasses to specify the objects it creates.

  • classes delegate responsibility to one of several helper subclasses,
  and you want to localize the knowledge of which helper subclass is the
  delegate.

Structure

[]

Participants

  • Product (Document)

  – defines the interface of objects the factory method creates.

  • ConcreteProduct (MyDocument)

  – implements the Product interface.

  • Creator (Application)

  – declares the factory method, which returns an object of type
  Product. Creator may also define a default implementation of the
  factory method that returns a default ConcreteProduct object.

  – may call the factory method to create a Product object.

  • ConcreteCreator (MyApplication)

  – overrides the factory method to return an instance of a
  ConcreteProduct.

Collaborations

  • Creator relies on its subclasses to define the factory method so
  that it returns an instance of the appropriate ConcreteProduct.

Consequences

Factory methods eliminate the need to bind application-specific classes
into your code. The code only deals with the Product interface;
therefore it can work with any user-defined ConcreteProduct classes.

A potential disadvantage of factory methods is that clients might have
to subclass the Creator class just to create a particular
ConcreteProduct object. Subclassing is fine when the client has to
subclass the Creator class anyway, but otherwise the client now must
deal with another point of evolution.

Here are two additional consequences of the Factory Method pattern:

  1. Provides hooks for subclasses. Creating objects inside a class with
  a factory method is always more flexible than creating an object
  directly. Factory Method gives subclasses a hook for providing an
  extended version of an object.

  In the Document example, the Document class could define a factory
  method called CreateFileDialog that creates a default file dialog
  object for opening an existing document. A Document subclass can
  define an application-specific file dialog by overriding this factory
  method. In this case the factory method is not abstract but provides a
  reasonable default implementation.

  2. Connects parallel class hierarchies. In the examples we’ve
  considered so far, the factory method is only called by Creators. But
  this doesn’t have to be the case; clients can find factory methods
  useful, especially in the case of parallel class hierarchies.

  Parallel class hierarchies result when a class delegates some of its
  responsibilities to a separate class. Consider graphical figures that
  can be manipulated interactively; that is, they can be stretched,
  moved, or rotated using the mouse. Implementing such interactions
  isn’t always easy. It often requires storing and updating information
  that records the state of the manipulation at a given time. This state
  is needed only during manipulation; therefore it needn’t be kept in
  the figure object. Moreover, different figures behave differently when
  the user manipulates them. For example, stretching a line figure might
  have the effect of moving an endpoint, whereas stretching a text
  figure may change its line spacing.

  With these constraints, it’s better to use a separate Manipulator
  object that implements the interaction and keeps track of any
  manipulation-specific state that’s needed. Different figures will use
  different Manipulator subclasses to handle particular interactions.
  The resulting Manipulator class hierarchy parallels (at least
  partially) the Figure class hierarchy:

[]

  The Figure class provides a CreateManipulator factory method that lets
  clients create a Figure’s corresponding Manipulator. Figure subclasses
  override this method to return an instance of the Manipulator subclass
  that’s right for them. Alternatively, the Figure class may implement
  CreateManipulator to return a default Manipulator instance, and Figure
  subclasses may simply inherit that default. The Figure classes that do
  so need no corresponding Manipulator subclass—hence the hierarchies
  are only partially parallel.

  Notice how the factory method defines the connection between the two
  class hierarchies. It localizes knowledge of which classes belong
  together.

Implementation

Consider the following issues when applying the Factory Method pattern:

  1. Two major varieties. The two main variations of the Factory Method
  pattern are (1) the case when the Creator class is an abstract class
  and does not provide an implementation for the factory method it
  declares, and (2) the case when the Creator is a concrete class and
  provides a default implementation for the factory method. It’s also
  possible to have an abstract class that defines a default
  implementation, but this is less common.

  The first case requires subclasses to define an implementation,
  because there’s no reasonable default. It gets around the dilemma of
  having to instantiate unforeseeable classes. In the second case, the
  concrete Creator uses the factory method primarily for flexibility.
  It’s following a rule that says, “Create objects in a separate
  operation so that subclasses can override the way they’re created.”
  This rule ensures that designers of subclasses can change the class of
  objects their parent class instantiates if necessary.

  2. Parameterized factory methods. Another variation on the pattern
  lets the factory method create multiple kinds of products. The factory
  method takes a parameter that identifies the kind of object to create.
  All objects the factory method creates will share the Product
  interface. In the Document example, Application might support
  different kinds of Documents. You pass Create-Document an extra
  parameter to specify the kind of document to create.

  The Unidraw graphical editing framework [VL90] uses this approach for
  reconstructing objects saved on disk. Unidraw defines a Creator class
  with a factory method Create that takes a class identifier as an
  argument. The class identifier specifies the class to instantiate.
  When Unidraw saves an object to disk, it writes out the class
  identifier first and then its instance variables. When it reconstructs
  the object from disk, it reads the class identifier first.

  Once the class identifier is read, the framework calls Create ,
  passing the identifier as the parameter. Create looks up the
  constructor for the corresponding class and uses it to instantiate the
  object. Last, Create calls the object’s Read operation, which reads
  the remaining information on the disk and initializes the object’s
  instance variables.

  A parameterized factory method has the following general form, where
  MyProduct and YourProduct are subclasses of Product :

  []

  Overriding a parameterized factory method lets you easily and
  selectively extend or change the products that a Creator produces. You
  can introduce new identifiers for new kinds of products, or you can
  associate existing identifiers with different products.

  For example, a subclass MyCreator could swap MyProduct and YourProduct
  and support a new TheirProduct subclass:

  []

  Notice that the last thing this operation does is call Create on the
  parent class. That’s because MyCreator::Create handles only YOURS ,
  MINE , and THEIRS differently than the parent class. It isn’t
  interested in other classes. Hence MyCreator extends the kinds of
  products created, and it defers responsibility for creating all but a
  few products to its parent.

  3. Language-specific variants and issues. Different languages lend
  themselves to other interesting variations and caveats.

  Smalltalk programs often use a method that returns the class of the
  object to be instantiated. A Creator factory method can use this value
  to create a product, and a ConcreteCreator may store or even compute
  this value. The result is an even later binding for the type of
  ConcreteProduct to be instantiated.

  A Smalltalk version of the Document example can define a documentClass
  method on Application . The documentClass method returns the proper
  Document class for instantiating documents. The implementation of
  documentClass in MyApplication returns the MyDocument class. Thus in
  class Application we have

  []

  In class MyApplication we have

  documentClass
           ^ MyDocument

  which returns the class MyDocument to be instantiated to Application .

  An even more flexible approach akin to parameterized factory methods
  is to store the class to be created as a class variable of Application
  . That way you don’t have to subclass Application to vary the product.

  Factory methods in C++ are always virtual functions and are often pure
  virtual. Just be careful not to call factory methods in the Creator’s
  constructor—the factory method in the ConcreteCreator won’t be
  available yet.

  You can avoid this by being careful to access products solely through
  accessor operations that create the product on demand. Instead of
  creating the concrete product in the constructor, the constructor
  merely initializes it to 0. The accessor returns the product. But
  first it checks to make sure the product exists, and if it doesn’t,
  the accessor creates it. This technique is sometimes called lazy
  initialization . The following code shows a typical implementation:

  []

  4. Using templates to avoid subclassing. As we’ve mentioned, another
  potential problem with factory methods is that they might force you to
  subclass just to create the appropriate Product objects. Another way
  to get around this in C++ is to provide a template subclass of Creator
  that’s parameterized by the Product class:

  []

  With this template, the client supplies just the product class—no
  subclassing of Creator is required.

  []

  5. Naming conventions. It’s good practice to use naming conventions
  that make it clear you’re using factory methods. For example, the
  MacApp Macintosh application framework [App89] always declares the
  abstract operation that defines the factory method as
  Class* DoMakeClass() , where Class is the Product class.

Sample Code

The function CreateMaze (page 84 ) builds and returns a maze. One
problem with this function is that it hard-codes the classes of maze,
rooms, doors, and walls. We’ll introduce factory methods to let
subclasses choose these components.

First we’ll define factory methods in MazeGame for creating the maze,
room, wall, and door objects:

  []

Each factory method returns a maze component of a given type. MazeGame
provides default implementations that return the simplest kinds of maze,
rooms, walls, and doors.

Now we can rewrite CreateMaze to use these factory methods:

  []

Different games can subclass MazeGame to specialize parts of the maze.
MazeGame subclasses can redefine some or all of the factory methods to
specify variations in products. For example, a BombedMazeGame can
redefine the Room and Wall products to return the bombed varieties:

  []

An EnchantedMazeGame variant might be defined like this:

Known Uses

Factory methods pervade toolkits and frameworks. The preceding document
example is a typical use in MacApp and ET++ [WGM88] . The manipulator
example is from Unidraw.

Class View in the Smalltalk-80 Model/View/Controller framework has a
method defaultController that creates a controller, and this might
appear to be a factory method [Par90] . But subclasses of View specify
the class of their default controller by defining
defaultControllerClass, which returns the class from which
default-Controller creates instances. So defaultControllerClass is the
real factory method, that is, the method that subclasses should
override.

A more esoteric example in Smalltalk-80 is the factory method
parserClass defined by Behavior (a superclass of all objects
representing classes). This enables a class to use a customized parser
for its source code. For example, a client can define a class SQLParser
to analyze the source code of a class with embedded SQL statements. The
Behavior class implements parserClass to return the standard Smalltalk
Parser class. A class that includes embedded SQL statements overrides
this method (as a class method) and returns the SQLParser class.

The Orbix ORB system from IONA Technologies [ION94] uses Factory Method
to generate an appropriate type of proxy (see Proxy ( 207 )) when an
object requests a reference to a remote object. Factory Method makes it
easy to replace the default proxy with one that uses client-side
caching, for example.

Related Patterns

Abstract Factory ( 87 ) is often implemented with factory methods. The
Motivation example in the Abstract Factory pattern illustrates Factory
Method as well.

Factory methods are usually called within Template Methods ( 325 ). In
the document example above, NewDocument is a template method.

Prototypes ( 117 ) don’t require subclassing Creator. However, they
often require an Initialize operation on the Product class. Creator uses
Initialize to initialize the object. Factory Method doesn’t require such
an operation.
